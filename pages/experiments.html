                "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is
                extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will
                go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly
                woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya
                literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity
                to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they
                say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE
                idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase
                "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.
                I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in
                confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity
                them. ðŸ˜‚"

                "And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies'
                eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably
                lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ðŸ˜Ž" - some guy on reddit
