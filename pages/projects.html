				<h2>FillSolver</h2>

			<p>
				FillSolver is an Android Application that solves puzzles generated by the game Fill One-Line Puzzle
				Game. It is a game where you have to fill in all the squares on the gameboard with a single,
				non-overlapping path. This project started off as a result of a friendly competition between my
				girlfriend and I to see who can solve more puzzles. As I was playing, I remembered a previous project I
				had done where I created a solver for the word game Boggle using recursive backtracking. Fill and Boggle
				share a lot of commonalities because they both have a grid as the gameboard and both games' solutions
				consist of contiguous grid cells lining up together. Initially, I created a command line program for
				FillSolver that used the same algoritihm as Boggle. However, the interface was very clunky and involved
				the user punching in a bunch of grid coordinates to reproduce the gameboard. In college after I learned
				Android, I was able to go back to this project to create an Android application for it, allowing for a
				much better user experience. </p>
